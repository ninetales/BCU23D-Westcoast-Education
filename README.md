# Westcoast-Education-Typescript

We were assigned a case to create a proof of concept website for an educational website.

The goal was to create the following:

- A login/register system without any focus on security.
- Different user roles (admin/student)
- Book a course functionality.
- Ability to create a new course as admin user.
- Ability to view all courses and registred students.
- Display page of all courses.
- Responsive design

This project is using JSON SERVER as its proof of concept database.

There are already two users in the database:

Admin:
email: admin@demo.com

password: demo

Student:
email: student@demo.com

password: demo
